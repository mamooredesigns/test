//Now lets mix some maths and programming. In the function below (calculate_sphere) write a JavaScript program to calculate the volume and surface area of a sphere.
//take the radius from the input value element with the 'id=radius' in the index.html file
//And display the results in the elements with the 'id = volume' and 'id = area' respectively
//hint: the volumen of a sphere is ((4/3) × π × r^3) and the surface area is (4 × π × r^2)


const calculateSphere = () =>{

 }




//------------------------Question 4 ---------------------------
//Now in this exercise we want you to create 3 buttons, each with a click action that will hide the respective question's answer above. So if you click the "Hide Question 1" button it will hide from the DOM the answer to your first exercise. If you click it again it will show the answer.
